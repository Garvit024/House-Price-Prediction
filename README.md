# House-Price-Prediction

  Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. 
  In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. 
  The goal of this project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features

# Overview:-

  A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. 
  He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. 
  Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

  Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

    'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in.
    'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city.
    'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city.
    'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city.
    'Area Population': Population of city.
    'Price': Price that the house sold at.
    'Address': Address of the houses.

# Tools:-
  Python
  Numpy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Scikit-learn
  
# Conclusion:-
  
  We can estimate the house price of the data set by applying linear regression algorithm.
  And the regression scores of train data set and test data set are 0.9181223200568411 and 0.91768240096492 i.e. 
  the most appropriate predictions in the model.
